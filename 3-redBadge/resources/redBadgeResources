Disclaimer: It is really NOT a good idea to pull random tutorial videos from YouTube.  When looking to a video source for help, it is important that you are watching quality content that helps you learn the MATERIAL, not simply how to build a PROJECT.  

In this industry, it is very important to be able to read the documentation!  ALWAYS default at reading the docs and supliment your learning with other mediums.
