GARDEN PROJECT (TEAM GIT WITH ANGULAR AND POSTGRESQL)
**************************

A client has come to you and asked you to make a garden website with the following:
A nice logo (make something up that looks nice)
A home page talking about the company
An about page talking about the client with a contact section bringing in Formspree
A products page talking about the products that brings in the seeded backend 
An admin feature that allows you to DELETE any individual product

Use Angular to create the site
Use git to push to a single repo on GitHub
Make it look nice

Presentations for the 'client' will be tomorrow after lunch
