First challenge:

Using an html file, write a webpage that asks the user for input on a store, a quantity, and a product.
Save the user input in 3 separate variables.  Once the user has input their information, your webpage should
console.log a sentence using those 3 variables.  For example: 'I shopped at *Target* for *5* *apples*' may be
output to the console.  

Finally, ask for more input from the user that requests an array*****.  Save this array in a variable and
console.log that variable.  If you console.log(typeof <your array here>), what does the console show?
What does that teach you?

Need to knows for this challenge:
1)  Using JavaScript, window.prompt('<you message here>') lets you grab typed input from the user
2)  You can write JavaScript in an html file by using <script> tags.  Here's an example below:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    console.log('this JavaScript works inside the HTML file!');
  </script>
</body>
</html>

Second challenge:
Write a conditional that will check the value of one property in an object and console.log a message
based upon the type of the property.  

For instance, if sampleObject.sampleKey is a string, it will console.log 'the value is a string'.  If
sampleObject.sampleKey is a number, it will console.log 'the value is a number'.  Make sure your conditional
works for objects too!

If you have successfully solved this challenge with an if-elseif statement, try it with a ternary.

Third challenge*****:
Submit a text response that explains the below for the sample JavaScript code provided:
*****how many times does the play function get called
1)  Why does the first console.log in the function output 'a' for first, but 'middleName' for second?
2)  Why does the final console.log in the function output 'middleName' for second, but '3' for third?
3)  Why does the first console.log in the function output 'undefined' for third?

const first = 'firstName';
let second = 'middleName';
var third = 'lastName';

function play(){
  const first = 'a';
  console.log(first, second, third);
  if (5 > 4){
    const first = 1;
    let second = 2;
    var third = 3;
    console.log(first, second, third);
  }
  console.log(first, second, third);
}

play();
console.log(first, second, third);
