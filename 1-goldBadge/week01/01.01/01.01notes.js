Introduction to Class Assignment:
Students will pair with a partner to do the following:
Using codepen, design a static webpage that explains who you and your partner are, why you each decided 
to attend 1150 Academy, what your experience is with coding, and a picture of your favorite tv show character.

Your site must include an h1 tag, p tags, div tags, and img tags.
Your site needs to be styled using CSS.
Be prepared to show it off to the class!

//teacher notes: have one student drive while the other student navigates, then have students switch positions half way through

Variables, Types, Console.log Assignment: (need 2 more challenges)
Challenge 1:
Make 3 variables.  Your first variable should be a string.  Your second variable should be an array, which
has a string inside.  Your final variable should be an object, which has a property which is a string.

Write 3 console.log messages which show the string from each type of variable.

Challenge 2:
Make 7 variables: one is a string, one a number, one a boolean, one is undefined, one null, one
an array, and one an object.  Write a console.log message showing the type of each variable.  What
surprises you about this?

Challenge 3:
Make 2 variables.  The first is an array, the second is an object.  Inside each variable, store a string,
a number, a boolean, an undefined, a null, an array, and an object.
Once you've defined each variable, use console.log messages to output every value within your array and
your object.

Challenge 4:
intro to comparison operators (==, !=)
intro to if-else
Make a variable representing the status of a light switch.  If the light switch is off, turn it on.
If the light switch is on, turn it off.  Console.log the result of the variable after the conditional.

Challenge 5:
present to them this color wheel:

Ask them to automate the following process:  for any given color starting point on the wheel, find the
color 2 counter-clockwise spaces from that starting point.

Article Reading Assignment:
Group students into groups of 3 (groups of 2 are ok-ish).  Each student should be given 15 mins to read
one of the following 3 articles:
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp
At the end of time, each student should present 3 things they learned from the article in a verbal/code
summary to the other 2 members of the group in 10 mins total for every group.  They should also include 3 things they
didn't understand about the article.
Last, each group will share with another group in the class something interesting about these topics in
code form.  Give students time to articulate their thoughts in VSC.
