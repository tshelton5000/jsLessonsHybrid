First challenge:
Write an html page that, upon mouseover of an image, adds a p tag to 
the bottom of the page that says: 'You entered the picture!'.  On mouseleave of
the image, add a p tag that says: 'You left the picture!'.

Second challenge:
Let's use the Rick and Morty API to grab character names and display them to the screen.
We want to focus on fetching and displaying content to the screen, so I'll share starter code with you.
The API states that we can grab character data using this baseURl:
'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/' with a number at the end.  Let's make our form
submit the character number we want to find and display that character's name in an h1 tag.  Remember
that you'll need to use a 'fetch' in order to access the Rick and Morty API.  Here's your starter code:
