2)  Zach and Tyler want to see your projects, not your Repls.  You should be
    working on your API project, the API book, finding an API you want to use
    for the project, or showing your tutorial/portfolio websites to your instructors
    for feedback.
3)  I will be conducting 1-on-1s with some students.  I'll be back to assist when
    those 1-on-1s are finished.
