First challenge:
Make 2 functions.  Each function accepts an array of strings and returns that array of strings after we
operate on that array.  The first function removes any elements from the input array that have 'q' or 'p'
in them (uppcase or lowercase).  The second function capitalizes the first letter of each string and leaves
the rest of the string untouched.

Here is a test with its output:

input-
let inputArr = ['tyler Michael shelton', 'LAINEY', '1150 academy', 'quietly tiptoe', 'this is a thing'];
console.log(qOrPRemover(capitalFirst(inputArr)));

output-
[ 'Tyler Michael Shelton',
  'LAINEY',
  '1150 Academy',
  'This Is A Thing' ]

Second challenge:
Write an html page with a div.  Inside the div, put an h1 tag with the title 'Coolest Avengers:'.
After the h1 tag, use p tags to list each of your favorite Avengers characters.  

Using a script tag, write JavaScript that will move all of the children nodes (the h1 and p tags) from
the div tag and into the body.  The content shouldn't change, but the placement of the h1 and p tags
will be different in the html.  Below is an example of the before and after:

<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Coolest Avengers:</h1>
    <p>Hulk</p>
    <p>Thor</p>
    <p>War Machine</p>
    <p>Scarlet Witch</p>
  </div>
  <script>
    ...
  </script>
</body>

<body>
  <h1>Coolest Avengers:</h1>
  <p>Hulk</p>
  <p>Thor</p>
  <p>War Machine</p>
  <p>Scarlet Witch</p>
  <div></div>
  <script>
    ...
  </script>
</body>

Third challenge:
Write some sample JavaScript that shows the following things about var, let, and const:
a)  let, const not hoisted
b)  var doesn't obey block scope, let, const do
c)  var, let, const all obey functional scope
