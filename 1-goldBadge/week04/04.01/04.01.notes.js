Dry-Erase Practice:
Challenge 1:
Write a function that accepts two names as parameters and then console.logs the full name to the console.

Example: greeting('Robin', 'Holler')

Challenge 2:
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100.
For multiples of 3, instead of the number, console.log 'Fizz'.
For multiples of 5, instead of the number, console.log 'Buzz'.
For multiples of 3 AND 5, instead of the number, console.log 'Fizz Buzz'.

Challenge 3:
Create an object literal called netflix.
It will have three properties: id, name, and seasonInfo.
Id will be an integer and name will be a string.
SeasonInfo will be an object which will have a property called episodeInfo, which is an array of more objects.
Those objects have an episode number property and an episodeName property.

You are welcome to fabricate the data.

Portfolio Discussion:
Start with the important elements specified by the project description:
https://elevenfifty.instructure.com/courses/14/assignments/264

Have students take 10 minutes to pair.  Each student should give the other student feedback 
on the following:
1)  Use of color.  Do the colors work together on the site?  Is there enough contrast between
color in backgrounds and color in the font so that the font is highly readable?
2)  Use of negative space.  Is the webpage jam-packed with content, to the point that the user is
overloaded, or on the flip side, is there so much negative space that the website feels lifeless?
3)  Use of fonts.  Do the fonts lead to an aesthetic that works for a professional portfolio and 
complement each other?
4)  Functionality--can the user find all the information required by the portfolio project rubric?
Is any important information omitted?

Repeat this process after students have received critique one time.
