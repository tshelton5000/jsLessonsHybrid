First challenge:
Using async/await, write a function that fetches a star wars character using the url:
'https://swapi.co/api/people/<number here>'.  It should console.log the results of the fetch
before console.logging a message saying 'this should print last'.

Second challenge:
Design a function that takes three inputs, which are the 3 side lengths of a triangle.  Use the (Converse
of the) Pythagorean Theorem to see if the triangle is a right triangle.  Return 'yes!' if it is, and 'no!'
if it isn't.

Third challenge:
Write a function which uses a custom-built promise inside.  If Date.now() has an even number of
millisecondes, the promise should resolve.  If Date.now() has an odd number of milliseconds, the promise
should reject.  In either case, use .then & .catch to handle the resolved or rejected promise and print
a message.
