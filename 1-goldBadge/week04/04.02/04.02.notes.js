Dry-Erase Questions:
1)  Write a function with 3 parameters, each of which will be a number.  The first
variable is MM, representing a month number, the second is DD, representing a 
day number, and the last is YYYY, representing a year number.  Your function
should return the concatentation of these 3 variables as MM/DD/YYYY.

2)  Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 10.  If the number is 
even, your program prints 'even steven!'. If the number is odd, your program
prints 'odd ball'.

3)  Simulate data you would get back from an API.  The data your API returns
is an array, with 3 values which are objects.  Each object has a 'name' and 'age'
property, with a third property called 'equipment', which stores strings of a
character's equipment (revolver, lasso, ten gallon hat, etc.).  Write an example
array that matches the description above.
