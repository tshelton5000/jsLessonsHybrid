Class Starters:
Have students create a repo for their javascriptLibrary folder

HTML/CSS Exercise:
Using an html file with a linked css file, make a brief page (no header or footer needed) which explains
the 2 things that help you greatly in learning code and the 2 things you struggle with mightily in learning
code.  Feel free to design this however you want, but use your time (45 minutes) to build this out and have
fun.  We'll use the 15 minutes following this exercise to show off some of our work!

Students need to create this sample webpage in a new project folder within a projects parent directory.
They should grab an animation they like from this webpage:
http://www.justinaguilar.com/animations/index.html#
Once students have finished working on their page, they should save their code in a github repo.

Array and Object challenges:

Challenge 1:
Build an array that has a string, a boolean, another array, an object, and a number inside.  Write a separate
console.log to show every value within the array.  Once you've done that, use a for-of loop to console.log
every value within the array.  If you can get the for-of loop to work correctly, try this with a .forEach.

Challenge 2:
Build an array with the values: 'swimming', 'running', 'yoga', 'biking', 'climbing'.  Add the value
'stretching' with 'splice', but don't remove any contents in the array.  Add the value 'basketball' with
'splice', but *do* remove one element.  Finally, use 'slice' to cut and save a portion of your array to 
a separate variable.  Use console.logs between every 'splice' or 'slice' to confirm that your array is 
changing as you expect it to. */

/*
Challenge 3:
This challenge has 2 parts.  First, create an object with 5 key-value pairs.  Using a Javascript feature 
demonstrated in your videos, create an array of all the keys in your object.  Use a for-of loop to
console.log every key in your keys array.
input: {key1: 'yeah!', key2: 1150, key3: true, key4: [1,2,3,4], key5: {innerKey: 'mind blown!'}}
output: key1, key2, key3, key4, key5
Once you've completed the above, use the .forEach method and your keys array to console.log all the values
in your object.  Show these values using [] notation but not using Object.values().
input: [key1, key2, key3, key4, key5]
output: 'yeah!', 1150, true, [1,2,3,4], {innerKey: 'mind blown!'}

Have students team into groups of 2.  Each group should take 20 minutes to read an article (assigned)
and build an example to demonstrate to another group what their method does.  Have students teach each
other in 10 minute intervals.
