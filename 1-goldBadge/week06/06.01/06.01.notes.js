Announcements:
1)  Gold Badge Presentations are Wednesday night.  No deployments, changes,
tweaks, etc. when presentations start @ 6:00.  Things should be deployed and
ready to go before class begins.  We will keep our laptops closed and our
attention on the speaker.  :)
2)  We will deploy our API projects to firebase tonight.
3)  You will be sent your gold badge rubric Thursday some time during the day.
If there are problems with your gold badge graduation status, I will send you
both a copy of your gold badge scores and a memo requesting that we meet to talk
1-on-1.
4)  You will be invited to a new blue badge Canvas class on Monday of next week.
If there are additional things you would like to explore and play with during
this weekend, lemme know if you need suggestions!  There's a lot you could still
do.  :)
5)  What do you think about a 6:00-9:00 schedule from Monday - Thursday?
6)  Complete projects status survey:
