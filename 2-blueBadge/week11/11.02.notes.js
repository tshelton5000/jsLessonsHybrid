Announcements:
1)  Welcome Michael Schutter.  Give him 30 minutes to introduce himself, discuss
    what he does in the industry, and for students to ask quesitons to him.
1)  By EOW, you should have a working node server book, a working 
    workoutlog server backend, and be cranking away on the react workoutlog book.
2)  Pie Server videos need to be watched (Rob recommends that they are watched
    before you build your workoutlog server, for reference).  Final pie server/client
    videos and the repl challenges solution video are coming later this week.
3)  Node server challenges (solvable through code sandbox) are still in the works.
4)  Tonight we're going to focus further on hashing out our blue badge projects.
5)  Saturday--we will have assessment paradise!  You'll have a testDome site made
    by yours truly with the code challenges.

Itinerary:
1)  Let's update our repl challenges app.  Github link here:
    https://github.com/tshelton5000/repl-challenges
    npm start to see that you have the most up-to-date content available
2)  Complete student survey:
    https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAkNO1JVcVSGaEacgB6eJCC7WgQHWEkJuVKkXhIgg2sugLfA/viewform
3)  Ideate for blue badge projects:
    a)  What is the theme of your project?  What interests you that you'd like to
        build a project based upon?
    b)  Based upon the theme you've chosen above, what data needs to be stored in the 
        database?  What models does this entail?
    c)  Wireframe the view of your project on your desks.  Remember that every separate
        visual element is either its own component or contained within one!
    d)  Draw your React component tree.  As you build this, consider the visual
        elements to be displayed by your components, the props to be passed from
        ancestor components, and which components will need to be responsible for 
        fetching.
4)  Start 1-on-1s with students!  Students not met with tonight have the books and
    videos to be completed.
