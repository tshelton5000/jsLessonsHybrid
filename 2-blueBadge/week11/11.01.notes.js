Announcements:
0)  Reiterate that Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are required class times.
    People should not be late to class or skipping altogether.  This class is hard
    work and finding a good job is not guaranteed by virtue of enrollment.
1)  By EOW, you should have a working node server book, a working 
    workoutlog server backend, and be cranking away on the react workoutlog book.
2)  Videos are posted for the node server intro.  These are late, but you should
    have videos 1-5 watched by the end of the week.  Additionally, I will have a 
    challenges solutions video (with an associated app discussed this evening) for 
    you to inspect and tear apart.
3)  Node server challenges (solvable through code sandbox) will be posted tomorrow.
    Your top priorities right now include:
      a)  Finishing the books
      b)  Watching all videos
      c)  and...
4)  You should be thinking about what you want to design for your blue badge
    project.  You're not behind if you've given it no thought so far, but we'll
    want to start ideating this evening!
5)  We are holding to the blue badge calendar, which involves transitioning this week
    from book work to starting our blue badge projects.

Itinerary:
0)  Show students the blue badge rubric.
1)  Check out the blue badge calendar.  Discuss that light videos and challenges
    will continue throughout the rest of blue.  You'll need to juggle your project
    (the biggest piece of your workload) with the videos and Saturday challenges.
2)  Comment in both check-in discussions when you can be available this Tuesday and
    Thursday.
3)  Check out the blue badge SOW with students:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nltI5o8lipHY9AiFOTcix1-o2lQG8MdXXSWKO1ihBcA/edit?usp=sharing
4)  Let Zach show students his blue badge project and how he planned it.
5)  Show students my blue badge project:
    tshelton5000.github.io
6)  Build for students on the sideboard a React component tree of how the app
    was planned.
7)  Sample problem:
    Plan an app which allows the user to create, edit, get, and delete items available
    through purchase online.  You shouldn't plan the authentication screen (which you
    have yet to see), but think about designing a React page for the main view, and
    what your server/models will look like, too.
8)  Answer questions for students.
9)  Repl challenges solved in a repo:
    https://github.com/tshelton5000/repl-challenges
10)  Open up to questions about Node and React.
