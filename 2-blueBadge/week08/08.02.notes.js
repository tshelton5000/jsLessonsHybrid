Itinerary:
1)  Effects Review/New (child comp of App)
  a)  Review how they can run a function after a return, with a dependency list
  b)  Effects can return a cleanup function
  c)  effect challenge:  build a new component.  in this component, create 1 state
  variable.  this variable should be 2-way bound to an input field (as the 
  input from the user changes, this first variable's text updates).  your component
  should also have an effect.  it should have a dependency list of one item--your
  state variable.  when your text length is a multiple of 5, your effect should create
  a new setinterval function and return a cleanup function to get rid of this interval.
  make the interval function say whatever you want, and it should run every 2 seconds.
2)  Terminal Game
