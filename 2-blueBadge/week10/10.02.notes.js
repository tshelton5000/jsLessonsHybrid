Announcements:
1)  Your blue badge will be graded as follows (this rubric will come this week):
    60% blue badge project
    20% blue badge project presentation
    20% code challenge solutions
2)  Your EOW goal for the Server book should be to finish the book, but it's ok 
    if this book carries over into next week.  Note that the server book finishes
    with you building a complete server on your own.  This will connect to your
    last intro book that we'll start next week.
3)  You should have seen 2 intro videos for Node Server, I will create the rest
    tomorrow.  I forgot to make them yesterday!  Doh!  They should be available
    Saturday.  I will continue to develop videos for you to watch throughout the
    rest of blue badge.  In 2 weeks, class time will open up to primarily be lab
    time for you, so your primary learning will be through videos and workshops
    Zach and I will run for you.
4)  Talk to students about reaching out to Abi Tambasco.  She will be their career
    services rep.

Itinerary:
1)  Have students break into teams of 3 assigned by me.  They should pull up the NYT
    code and discuss how the 2 components are working together.  Discuss as a class!
    The code is available in the folder for week 10.
2)  Using app.all(...) (check out the express docs!), replace the app.use we have
    in index.js to run validate session.
    app.all('*', validateSession);
3)
