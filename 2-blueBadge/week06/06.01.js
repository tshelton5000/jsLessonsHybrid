BRONZE DESCRIPTION:
  Design a '/user/create' endpoint that will let the user
  send a new user object through the server to the database.
  The server should store the user object sent and send
  a response to the user with a 200 status code and the user
  object saved if successful.  If the operation fails, the 
  server should respond with a 500 status code and an error
  message back.  Good luck!

SILVER DESCRIPTION:
  Complete the bronze level challenge above, but this time 
  create a '/user/login' endpoint that will let the user send
  a user object through the server and check with an existing
  user in the database.  On success, the user object should
  be sent back with an appropriate status code.  On failure,
  an appropriate status code and an error message should be sent.
  Good luck!

GOLD DESCRIPTION:
  Complete the silver level challenge above, but make sure
  that passwords are saved encrypted.  When the '/user/create'
  and '/user/login' endpoints send the user information back,
  make sure that information is sent in a sessionToken using
  jwt (this uses the jsonwebtoken dependency).  Good luck!
